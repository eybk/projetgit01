        Over 20,000 children in Gaza are orphans. Without the love, care and support of parents, many struggle to survive and are highly vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and neglect.<br>Islamic Relief’s child welfare programmes transform the lives of many vulnerable children. We sponsor over 7,000 orphaned children in Gaza, giving their families a regular stipend towards their basic needs and schooling.<br>Donate to our Palestine Appeal and help protect vulnerable orphans in Gaza. </div>

        <br>Our work includes providing safe homes and shelter, winter survival items, access to education and healthcare,
        as well as mental health services for vulnerable children.
        <br>For example, Palestinian children receive specialist support at Islamic Relief’s early intervention unit in Saida, Jordan.
        The unit provides physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy services as well as special education and psychotherapy.

    <div class="desc" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With its dense population and collapsing economy, the health sector is at breaking point in Gaza.
        There is a severe shortage of specialist staff and medical supplies. Electricity and water are also in short supply.
        <br>We provide urgent medical supplies when conflict breaks out in the region, or disaster strikes.<br>For example, Islamic Relief was at the forefront of the Covid-19 pandemic, disinfecting schools and hospitals and raising awareness of the virus to reduce the spread. We also provided medical equipment and hygiene kits to hospitals, health centres and quarantine centres.</div>

    <div class="desc" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winters in Palestine can be extremely harsh, and many live in dilapidated and substandard accommodation, with little protection from the elements. To make matters worse, many lack basic amenities such as warm clothing – leaving them vulnerable to the harsh weather and increasing their risk of becoming unwell. 
Islamic Relief repairs damaged homes in time for the winter season. From fixing roofs and repairing toilets, securing windows and improving electrical wiring, we make sure homes are habitable and safe. We also provide essential items mattresses, blankets, pillows, gas heaters and cookers through our annual winter survival programme, to help them cope with the harsh winter weather.
Help keep families in Gaza warm this winter by donating to our Palestine Appeal. </div>
