    Tunisia on Sunday said it sent humanitarian aid supplies to Palestine via Egypt, as Israeli continues its bombardment of Gaza after a surprise attack by Hamas. <br>
    A military aircraft carrying about 12 tons of aid materials, including medicines and food, which were collected by the Tunisian Red Crescent, is en route from the capital Tunis to Egypt, the Tunisian presidency said in a statement. <br>
    More supplies will be sent in the coming days, it added. <br>
    Earlier this week, Palestinian President Kais Saied stressed the need for tangible assistance to Palestine, declaring solidarity with the Palestinian people. <br>
    Last weekend, Israeli forces launched a sustained military push against the Gaza Strip in response to a military offensive by Hamas in Israeli territories. <br>
    The conflict began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against Israel – a multi-pronged surprise attack including a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel via land, sea, and air. <br>
    Hamas said the operation was in retaliation for the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem and Israeli settlers’ growing violence against Palestinians. <br>
    The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets within the Gaza Strip. <br>
    Israel's response has extended into cutting water and electricity supplies to Gaza, further worsening living conditions in an area that has endured a crippling siege since 2007, as well as ordering more than 1 million Gazans in the northern strip to evacuate to the southern strip.
